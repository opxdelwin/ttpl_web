# Textel Technologies - WEB

**Hi, welcome here!**

Myself ***Delwin***, a passionate `FlutterFire` Developer.

## Introduction

This is one of the projects that I worked on where I revamped website for ***Textel Technologies*** as an Intern.

Find the new webpage from the following link => https://textel-technologies-pvt-af40e.web.app/

Furthermore, I worked on a prototype of an app that enables OTA communication with their products. Repo will be created soon :)
